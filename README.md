Is it really a PoC my client is asking too much?

![How distinguish a PoC from full integration - For Dummies](https://dev.matlogica.com/matlogica/assets/PoC.png)

As a **start-up founder**, I’ve seen it too often: clients mistaking a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for full-scale **production integration**. 

So, let me set the record straight.

A PoC is meant to answer questions like:

1) "It’s a completely new technology — does it work at all?"
In this case, an isolated PoC in a small-scale environment is the right approach, aiming to demonstrate whether the technology works—or it doesn’t—without wasting significant resources. Whether it's paid or not is another discussion!

2) "I have an exceptional edge case — can this solution handle it?" - this is another solid foundation for a PoC - but free or not is another question!
If, as a customer, you don’t know your systems well enough to provide your vendor with a list of edge cases, it’s absolutely unfair to ask them to perform unpaid work on the entire system—especially when dealing with a 10-million-line codebase!


The **PoC is always small-scale and short-term** — we’re talking weeks, not months!

A PoC can be free, it can paid by the client, and even some PoC investment can be refunded if the project moves to production. Another option is having the PoCs open-source and free!

# But sometimes the clients expect much more from a PoC!

But when expectations start looking like full scope, full feature set, every test is expected to pass, and the release is in production (or production-like environment), it’s no longer a PoC. Think about it: if you're worried about every test passing, full feature set, full production deployment, the associated process changes, SLAs, support contracts, and escrow agreements, you’ve already decided and you don’t need a PoC - but a full integration! Or you might be in group 2), above. Alternatively, if you’re considering all these aspects before having answered the obvious questions, you are wasting everyone’s time!

# Real-world Examples:
Client 1: Spent a year integrating our solution, countless emails, and meetings, only to claim the PoC ‘failed’—after achieving 99% pass rates and **blisteringly fast performance** (which is our brand promise). That’s not a PoC; it’s production testing.
Client 2: Wanted full integration into production before paying anything. I mean, that’s like expecting a Michelin-star meal from the chef as a ‘free sample’ before deciding to order! Not fair, right?
(I can go on and on...)

# The Unfair Burden on Start-ups
In some cases, a PoC is a required tool, particularly for **Risk Management**. No one wants to dedicate endless resources to something that can fail - If it’s going to fail, fail fast! A PoC, especially, a free PoC needs to be balanced and calibrated to the clients' R&D budgets, appetites, timelines, and importantly, trust in founders.
Positioning a production-level task as a free PoC is not just a misunderstanding, it reflects an imbalance of power and disrespect to founders. Startups can be forced into delivering unpaid work—sometimes unrelated to their core offering to secure a paid project. While large organizations don't run their R&D departments for free (often with big budgets and failing projects), asking a small company to do so undermines the innovation and agility that the large companies are seeking. The practice is unfair, erodes trust, and discourages creative collaboration.

I’m curious to hear from other founders about their experiences with PoCs. Have they ever been asked to deliver well beyond what you’d call a PoC? And from the industry: how can we make this process more equitable for young companies?
